## Project Description
In this project, we were provided with a dataset comprising various features of different Hollywood movies. Specifically, the dataset included 13 features, and our objective was to classify the gender of the lead actor based on these features. Thus, the main task of the project involved conducting binary classification to determine the gender of lead actors in these Hollywood movies. The provided variables and their corresponding types are outlined in the tables below.

| Feature                                          | Type     |
|--------------------------------------------------|----------|
| Number of words spoken by female                | Ratio    |
| Total number of words                           | Ratio    |
| Number of words spoken by lead actor            | Ratio    |
| Difference in words spoken between lead and co-lead | Ratio    |
| Number of male actors                           | Ratio    |
| Year                                             | Interval |
| Number of female actors                         | Ratio    |
| Number of words spoken by male                  | Ratio    |
| Gross                                            | Ratio    |
| Mean age of male actors                         | Ratio    |
| Mean age of female actors                       | Ratio    |
| Age of lead actor                               | Ratio    |
| Age of co-lead actor                            | Ratio    |
| Lead (Target Variable)                            | Nominal  |

## Data Analysis
Additionally, alongside the classification task, we were assigned to address specific inquiries based on the data, leading to a comprehensive analysis. The questions posed were as follows:

* **Do men or women dominate speaking roles in Hollywood movies?**
  Our analysis revealed that males comprised 68% of all actors with speaking roles, while females accounted for only 21% of the total words spoken in movies.
